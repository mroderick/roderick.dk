## Summary

I am a seasoned software engineer with a couple of decades of professional experience. My primary focus is on building high quality software products with long life span and low effort maintenance.

I am aiming towards a role as Staff Engineer or Principal Engineer. I am particulary interested in learning golang, and continue my work of mentoring/growing software engineers.

I have extensive experience with building and maintaining [Single Page Applications][spa], highly resilient web applications using [progressive enhancement][pr-enh] as well as high quality JavaScript libraries (see [Sinon.JS](https://sinonjs.org)). I am equally comfortable working both client- and server-side.

Over the time of my career I've naturally spent time with many different programming languages, libraries and frameworks, servers, etc. Please ask for specifics.

Code craft and developing good practices excite me a lot more than ephemeral frameworks, build tools, transpilers, etc.. I think that great outcomes can be achieved by applying good practices with carefully chosen tools.

These books have been influential to me. You will often hear me recommend them to other developers:

- [Clean Code][cleancode]
- [Eloquent JavaScript][eloquent-js]
- [Implementing Service Level Objectives][implslo]
- [Observability Engineering][obseng]
- [Refactoring][refactoring]
- [Release It!][release-it]
- [Working Effectively with Legacy Code][legacycode]

As a natural part of my work, I work with other engineers to hone their skills, especially around refactoring and unit testing. I am a [core member of the Sinon.JS project][sinon]. I'm a fan of pair programming and am mentoring junior engineers and beginners in my free time.

Outside of my work life, I am passionate about cooking, motorcycling and photography, as well as participating in community work.
