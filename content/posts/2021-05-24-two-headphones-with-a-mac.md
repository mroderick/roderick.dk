My partner and I travelled back to Berlin from Las Palmas on a flight on Saturday. Since it was not a long haul flight, there would be no in-flight entertainment. We wanted to wanted to watch series and movies together using my computer, while both using noise cancelling headphones.

This turned out to be surprisingly easy to do.

I'll be sure to do this for our journey, which I hope to make by train. That would make watching a couple of lectures or interesting talks from conferences quite enjoyable.
