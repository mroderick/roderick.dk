As a followup to my two part article about [Creating Sitemaps with Comatose CMS](/2009/03/16/creating-sitemaps-with-comatose-cms/), I wanted to share with you, how I am currently implementing Sitemaps on this blog.

After taking a stab at implementing my own solution for about 10 minutes (with [Webby](http://webby.rubyforge.org/), you get surprisingly far in 10 minutes), I used my google-fu and found an article about [Easy Google/Yahoo! Sitemaps with webby](http://www.opensourcery.co.za/2008/10/19/easy-googleyahoo-sitemaps-with-webby). Implementation took about 5 minutes, and I have have a fully functional Sitemap.
