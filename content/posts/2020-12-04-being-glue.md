> Stop interviewing, stop organising the off-sites, stop onboarding, stop fielding requests from users, stop anything that sounds like team building. Stop helping other people with their work. Archive mail. Quit slack channels. Do not curate the team roadmap.
>
> Crucially: don't catch things that are about to drop. That's incredibly hard for a lot of us, but remember that the rest of the team already does this.
>
> Stop being the unofficial lead. (If you're in the same situation and you're the official lead, consider stopping that too!)
