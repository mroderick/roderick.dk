The [Lean Web book](https://leanweb.dev/ebook/) is very good and recommended for anyone buidling things for the web.

[Chris Ferdinandi](https://gomakethings.com) has managed to capture many of the thoughts and ideas, that many of us of have been thinking about since the "JavaScript revolution" started.

There's [a talk](https://leanweb.dev/talk/) too, if you're more into that.
