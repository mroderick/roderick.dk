The next [Homebrew Website Club](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club) in Berlin will be on October 2nd at 18.30.

### Venue

[Fy!](https://www.iamfy.co)<br/>
Hinterhof Rechts - 5'<br/>
Glogauer Strasse 5<br/>
10999 Berlin

There will be a few signs with Homebrew Website Club on them, to make it easy to find.

### Structure

We will try to follow the [recommended structure](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club#structure). This means we will have a "Quiet Writing Hour", which I am very excited about.

See you there?
