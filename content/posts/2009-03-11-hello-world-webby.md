You might wonder what is going on with this site right now, and it might look very incomplete at the moment you are viewing it.

I am rebuilding the website using [Webby](http://webby.sourceforge.org), a small web generation tool. It is purely a learning experience, but with a very tangible end goal: an easy-to-manage blog.

Predictions are that the site will be updated at highly irregular intervals, as I am hacking away at just about everything at once.
