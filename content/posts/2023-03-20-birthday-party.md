Uyanga and I will be celebrating our combined 90 years on this planet by having a birthday party on 2023-06-24 in the afternoon. It will be in Berlin, Germany and will be fairly casual.

There will be some food ... think mingling with a plate of delicious bits, not sitting down for a three course meal. There will be some drinks of what people like drinking on a Saturday afternoon in summer.

Please don't get us any presents, we have more than enough earthly belongings. Instead, a small donation towards paying for the party would be very welcome. Please send donations to [my PayPal](https://paypal.me/MorganRoderick).

There will be more details about exact venue and time to those that RSVP at a later state.

RSVP: please send me an email at <a href="mailto:morgan@roderick.dk?subject=RSVP: Birthday Party">morgan@roderick.dk</a> before 2023-06-01.
