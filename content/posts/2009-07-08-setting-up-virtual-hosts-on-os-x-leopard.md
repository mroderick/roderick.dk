Working with a new client and getting back to my roots of doing pure frontend development, I had to set up a virtual host for development on my MBP.

When working with Rails, I usually just use `script/server` and/or Passenger to serve my applications... in this situation i just needed to serve some static files.

I found [Mark Kirby's excellent tutorial on Setting up virtual hosts on OS X Leopard](http://mark-kirby.co.uk/2008/setting-up-virtual-hosts-on-os-x-leopard/) and am posting it here, so I won't forget in the future.
