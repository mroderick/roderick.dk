I firmly believe that writing a good git history, or _narrative_ is important and worthwhile.

Future Developer will thanks us when they're using `git log -S` to find a particular line or fragment, or when they're using `git bisect` to figure out when and how a particular defect was introduced.

In the past I've given a talk about crafting a lovely git narrative. Thankfully, there's no recording of that talk.

However, both of these two talks are recorded, and are much better than mine.

* [How to Craft Your Commit History][1] by Tatiana Stantonian
* [Getting more from Git][2] by Alice Bartlett

At the time of recording, both these people worked at Financial Times. It's almost as if that organisation cares about good use of git... maybe I should apply to work there ðŸ¤”

Enjoy!
