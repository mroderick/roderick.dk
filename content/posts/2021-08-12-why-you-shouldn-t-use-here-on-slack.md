> #### The Rules (according to Graham)
> - Don’t use `@here` unless it is truly relevant to everyone in a channel
> - Don’t use `@channel` unless there is a fire or a nuclear explosion that everyone needs to be aware of now
> - Use targeted Slack group mentions for getting a hold of stakeholders in a channel (i.e. `@support_` in the `#support` channel)
> - Use Slack as an asynchronous medium, not a synchronous one (assume people will not respond immediately, rather than the opposite)
