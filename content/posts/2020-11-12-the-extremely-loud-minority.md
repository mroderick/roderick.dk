> It’s understandable to think that JavaScript frameworks and their communities are eating the web because places like Twitter are _awash with very loud voices from said communities_.
> Always remember that although a **subset of the JavaScript community can be very loud**, they represent a **paltry portion of the web as a whole**. This means that when *they* say something like "CSS sucks" — what they mean is "CSS sucks for a small subset of less than 1 percent of the web".
