> Unlike many tutorials today, this one will focus on minimizing the technical requirements to follow along. We will get up and running with TypeScript without opening a terminal, installing dependencies, or even initializing an NPM project. In the advanced portion we will need to do a bit of that, but for most users, all you will need is Visual Studio Code as your editor.
