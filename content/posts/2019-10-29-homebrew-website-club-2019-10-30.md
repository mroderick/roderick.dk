The next [Homebrew Website Club](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club) in Berlin will be on October 30th at 18.30.

### Venue

We will be hosted by my former client, employer [Zalando SE](https://zalando.de), in one of their offices.

[Zalando SE<br/>
M√ºhlenstra√üe 25<br/>
10243 Berlin<br/>](https://www.google.com/maps/place/M%C3%BChlenstra%C3%9Fe+25,+10243+Berlin/@52.505676,13.4408892,17.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a84e4f6a2213e3:0xadde84f313f308f9!8m2!3d52.5054036!4d13.4398896)

There will be a few signs with Homebrew Website Club on them, to make it easy to find and the front desk know we're coming.

### Food & drink

Zalando are treating us to pizza and drinks üëç

### Structure

We will try to follow the [recommended structure](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club#structure). This means we will have a "Quiet Writing Hour", which I am very excited about.

Hoping to see you there!
