Last year I learned how to use [two headphones with a Mac](/2021/05/24/two-headphones-with-a-mac/), which is a great feature to use when travelling. Basically, we can watch movies in Apple TV on one computer.

Since our travel last year, my partner has switched from their Sony over the ear headphones (with built-in amplifier) to Airpods Pro (no built-in amplifier).

That gave us some challenges, as they could not really hear what was going on, and couldn't turn the volume up due to those headphones not having volume controls or amplifier. My Sony headphones do not have those challenges, so I was fine with the Multi-output audio.

The solution to this challenge is described in great detail by Fatima Wahab in [How to manage volume for Multi-output Audio devices on macOS](https://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/manage-volume-for-multi-output-audio-devices-on-macos/).

The solution worked perfectly for us, and we could pass time together on our travels again.
